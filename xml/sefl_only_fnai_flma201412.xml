      <abstract>FLORIDA CONSERVATION LANDS (layer name FLMA): This is a polygon data layer for public (and some private) lands that the Florida Natural Areas Inventory (FNAI) has identified as having natural resource value and that are being managed at least partially for conservation purposes. The term "Managed Area" refers to a managed conservation land.</abstract>
      <purpose>To prepare a comprehensive statewide dataset on managed conservation lands by compiling data from diverse sources, and to make this data set available for public use.</purpose>

        <procdesc>This GIS data layer was generated by the Florida Natural Areas Inventory (FNAI) using ArcView v 3.2 and ArcGIS v 10.1. Source polygons were developed from the BIOTICS ArcView application. Information in the FLMA data layer was provided to FNAI by the individual managing agencies. Boundary information on managed areas was originally in either digital format or on paper source maps at varying scales. New digital boundary files were integrated into FLMA by FNAI staff. In the case of paper source maps, boundaries were either transcribed by FNAI staff onto 1:24,000 USGS topographic quadrangles and then digitized, or boundaries from paper maps were transcribed by FNAI staff in ArcView or ArcMap using underlying USGS 1:24,000 DRG and/or 2004 DOQQs and on-screen digitization methods. FNAI staff then integrated these new digital boundaries into FLMA. The attribute item DIG_COM in the FLMA layer provides details on the derivation of boundaries for individual managed areas. The following digitizers were used by the FNAI staff: CalComp DBII, accuracy of +/- .01 inch CalComp DBIII, accuracy of +/- .005 inch CalComp 9500 Series, accuracy of +/- .005 inch. When digital boundaries from one source overlapped with digital boundaries from another source, the boundaries were adjusted by FNAI staff to eliminate the overlapping areas. Adjustments were made based on the best known information about the source of the boundaries. All overlaps greater than 0.002 meters were removed using this process.</procdesc>

Code for the Managed Area by lead managing agency. Each Managed Area has been coded as

1st byte = Managing Agency Category:
F=Federal, S=State, L=Local, P=Private

2nd and 3rd bytes = Managing Agency: (e.g., AF= US Air Force)

4th and 5th bytes = Managed Area Unit Type (e.g., AB= Air Force Base)

If a managing agency has only one type of MA Unit, the MA Unit Type code can be the managing agency code repeated (e.g., for Audubon of Florida sanctuaries, the code is PFAFA).

            <edomv>1</edomv>
            <edomvd>Category I. This is the highest protection and reserved for lands that are specifically and judiciously managed for biodiversity protection.  This category includes lands owned by private entities that are managed for biodiversity conservation, and lands administered by public agencies that are specially designated for biodiversity conservation through legislative action where natural events proceed without interference or are mimicked through management.  The governmental agency acting alone cannot change these designations without legislative action and public involvement.  Examples include The Nature Conservancy preserves and other private preserves committed to biodiversity conservation, preserves that are state-owned and managed, some national parks, federal wilderness areas, and some local preserves.  For FNAI purposes, this designation will generally apply to the following:  private sanctuaries and preserves, state preserves and botanical sites,  many local preserves purchased and managed as environmentally sensitive lands, most national parks and seashores, national marine sanctuaries, and federal research natural areas.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Category II. This second category applies to lands that are generally managed for their natural values but that may incur additional uses such as habitat manipulation for game species and/or some recreation infrastructure.  These activities will likely degrade the quality of natural communities locally but the majority of the land will be managed for biodiversity protection.  It also includes public lands with administrative designations for biodiversity conservation.  Examples include private preserves managed for game species, national wildlife refuges, BLM areas of critical environmental concern, and state parks.  For FNAI purposes, this designation will generally apply to the following: state parks, state reserves, state geological sites, state buffer preserves and aquatic preserves, wildlife and environmental areas, national wildlife refuges, some national park lands, and many locally managed lands purchased for natural resource protection.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Category III. This category applies to lands maintained for multiple uses, including consumptive or recreational values, and not specifically or wholly dedicated to biodiversity conservation.  It also includes lands with restricted development rights.  Unrestricted public access is one criterion that may cause a property to be placed into this category.  Examples include most nondesignated (i.e., multiple-use) public lands administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, Department of Defense lands, state forests, regional and large local parks and open space, and private lands protected from subdivision by conservation easements and other title restrictions.  For FNAI purposes, this designation will apply to state recreation areas, state gardens and trails, state forests, wildlife management areas, mitigation parks, lands managed by FL DEP Office of Greenways and Trails, most water management district properties, national forests, most Department of Defense lands, many local parks, and conservation easements on private properties.  It also includes lands tracked primarily for administrative reasons, such as state historic and archaeological sites, state museums, fish management areas, national memorials, and national fish hatcheries.</edomvd>

    <overview>
      <eaover>
ZZ = Not applicable or data not available.

When performing statistical analyses on the TOTACRES field (i.e., using ArcView or ArcGIS to calculate total acreages for a group of Managed Areas), subtract all Managed Areas that are a part of a major Managed Area (i.e., Managed Areas that have a MAJOR_MA).  This is necessary to avoid duplication of acreages since the TOTACRES field for a major Managed Area includes the acreage(s) of smaller Managed Area(s) nested within it.
