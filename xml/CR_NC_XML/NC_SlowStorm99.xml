<abstract>
The National Hurricane Center, in cooperation with the
North Carolina Center for Geographic Information and Analysis,
developed the GIS data set, Hurricane Storm Surge Inundation
Areas (1993), to reevaluate the extent of the areas affected
by hurricane inundation along the North Carolina coast.  The data depicts
the extent of hurricane storm surge inundation areas based
on SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes)
models, for the North Carolina coast. This is the metadata for the
SLOW model (with forward velocities of less than or equal to
15mph). Storm surge is the abnormal rise in water level caused by
wind and pressure forces of a hurricane or tropical storm.
The SLOSH model was developed using various combinations of hurricane
strength (based on the Saffir-Simpson scale), wind speed, and direction of
movement. Rainfall produced by a hurricane is not taken into account.
This data is stored in a county library by county extent.
</abstract>
<purpose>
This data was created to assist governmental agencies and
others in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic
Information System (GIS).
</purpose>
<supplinf>
There are several county-based coverages associated with this data layer.  The
county names below show inundation limit file sizes for the 'slow'
hurricanes (with forward velocities of less than or equal to
15mph).  There are coverages depicting inundation limits for the 'fast'
hurricanes (those with forward velocities greater than 15mph) as well.

&gt;Revisions and updates to this layer include:
&gt;6.) filenames: (countyabbrev)hss93s999, one metadata file.
&gt;Sept. 3, 1999: Updated one polygon coding error for surge value
&gt;in Dare County.
&gt;5.) directory: hss93_799 filenames: (countyabbrev)hss93s799
&gt;(countyabbrev)hss93f799
&gt;July 21, 1999 update includes surge updates for the following counties:
&gt;Carteret and Onslow. Detailed description of changes: Carteret
&gt;hss93s-id = 7 had surge update: '0' to '12'.  Onslow
&gt;hss93s-id = 194 had surge update: '0' to '3' and hss93s-id = 110 had
&gt;surge update: '0' to '12'.
&gt;4.) directory: (coabbrev)hss93_399  filenames: (coabbrev)hss93s399
&gt;&lt;countyabbrev&gt;hss93f399, two compliant metadata files.
&gt;March 3, 1999 update includes addition of storm surge data for the
&gt;following counties: Beaufort, Bertie, Camden, Carteret, Chowan, Craven,
&gt;Currituck, Dare, Gates, Hertford, Hyde, Jones, Pamlico, Pasquotank,
&gt;Perquimans, Tyrrell, and Washington.
&gt;3.) directory: hss93_1298  filename: hss93f1298 and hss93s1298.
&gt;There are 2 compliant metadata files.  The December
&gt;1998 update to this layer consisted of projecting the data from
&gt;NAD27 datum, State Plane projection, units of measure feet TO:
&gt;NAD83 DATUM, State Plane PROJECTION, UNITS OF MEASURE METERS.
&gt;This was done to comply with the NC Geographic Information
&gt;Coordinating Council's "Statement of Direction for North Carolina
&gt;Corporate Geographic Database Horizontal Reference, Datum and
&gt;Unit of Measure".  This reprojecting was done in various ways
&gt;depending on the data type and content. Vector data was projected
&gt;using the 'project' command in ESRI's Arc software and topology
&gt;was cleaned and built based on coverage needs.  Raster data was
&gt;projected using ESRI's Grid module and various steps as applicable.
&gt;2.) directory: hss93_295  filenames: hss93f295 and hss93s295
&gt;Represent the February 9, 1995 versions with 2 compliant metadata
&gt;files.  The update consisted of the deletion of duplicate label
&gt;points in both coverages.
&gt;These files were previously archived under the following names
&gt;but did not have compliant metadata. filename: hss93f.295  hss93s.295
&gt;1.) directory: hss93_994  filenames: nchss93f994  nchss93s994
&gt;September, 1994 was the original release date for these coverages.
&gt;Non-compliant metadata is in the info directory.

These data show the extent of hurricane storm surge inundation
areas based on SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from
Hurricanes) for the North Carolina coast based on a National Hurricane
Center 1993 study.  There are two coverages associated with the
data layer: one showing limits for the 'fast' hurricanes and one
showing limits for the 'slow' hurricanes.  The areas are labeled
according to hurricane strength (on the Saffir-Simpson scale)
measured by movement at miles per hour.

Hurricane storm surge inundation areas were marked onto
a third overlay, with 7.5 Minute USGS paper topographic maps
(which meet National Map Accuracy Standards) and SLOSH
plots underneath.  Boundaries drawn on the third overlay were digitized
and check plots used to ensure correct boundary location, within a
line width.

SLOSH models, provided by the National Hurricane Center,
and USGS topographic maps, both at 1:24,000 and with contour
lines, were overlayed and inundation interpolation was done onto
a third overlay.  The third overlay contained the limits of
inundation according to categories 1 and 2, category 3, and
categories 4 and 5 hurricanes.  Each limit, which was
differentiated by color, was then digitized.  Check plots
were made and overlayed to the originals for accuracy to a
pen width of the original linework.  Any necessary corrections
were made.  The coverages were then appended.

<eaover>
A polygon coverage depicting the extent of hurricane
storm surge inundation areas based on SLOSH (Sea,
Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) for southeastern
North Carolina, National Hurricane Center study, 1993.
The polygon attribute table (PAT) has attribute data including
total area in coverage units (square meters), total perimeter
(linear meters), polygon internal identification number, polygon
user identification number, and a number representing the
extent of inundation according to the category of the hurricane.
