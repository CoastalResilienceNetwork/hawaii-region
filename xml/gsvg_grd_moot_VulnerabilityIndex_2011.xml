We define vulnerability as a composite condition made up of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. This information is the ultimate product of the Socioeconomic Vulnerability Assessment under the Nature Conservancy's AWE Project. 

Scientists around the world agree that climate change is indisputable.  Impacts, including rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, warming temperatures and acidifying waters, dying coral reefs, shifting fish stocks, and incidence of flooding and drought, are already being felt, and are expected to continue and increase for decades to come. 

Nature holds some of the world’s best and most practical solutions to climate change, solutions that keep nature and people healthy, safe, and secure. The goal of At the Water’s Edge (AWE) is to demonstrate that governments and people in vulnerable coastal communities in Grenada and St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines (SVG) can enhance their resilience to climate change by protecting, restoring and effectively managing their marine and coastal ecosystems (also known as ecosystem-based adaptation or EBA) and strengthening local capacity for adaptation.</purpose></descript><spdom><bounding><westbc>-61.802482</westbc><eastbc>-61.378025</eastbc><northbc>12.531896</northbc><southbc>11.982904</southbc></bounding></spdom><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>GIS Data User AgreementAny Geographic Information System (GIS) data or information received from The Nature Conservancy (TNC) or downloaded from a TNC site (collectively “GIS Data”) is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).
